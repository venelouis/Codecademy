/* Dog Years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
Before you start doing the math in your head, 
let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables,
 use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.

Tasks:
1.Create a variable named myAge, and set it equal to your age as a number.
Write a comment that explains this line of code. */

const myAge = 34;
// a constant variable named: myAge ()wicth is 34 years).

/* 2. Create a variable named earlyYears and save the value 2 to it. 
Note, the value saved to this variable will change.
Write a comment that explains this line of code.*/

let earlyYears = 2;
// this variable will change (let)

/* 3. Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 
and reassign it to earlyYears.*/

earlyYears *= 10.5;
